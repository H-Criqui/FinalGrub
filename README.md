Final Project

Hi, this is my fork for a final project in my capstone class for computer science. In this project I worked with three other students to create a recipe sharing website using react. In the end we succeeded, with a few minor bugs. For our database, we used the free service section of MongoDB. Overall I would say that I am proud of the project even with it's small flaws. 

My Contributions:
- Leadership
- Setting up links
- Small additions to setting up user pages and recipe cards
